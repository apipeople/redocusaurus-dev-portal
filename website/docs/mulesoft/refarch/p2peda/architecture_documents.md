title: Architectural Documents 
---

This page details the documents and artifacts expected to be delivered in a standard project. 

This template can be modified on a project basis but serves as a template to accelerate delivery.

## Architectural Documents

### Platform Architecture 

### Solution Architecture 

The solution architecture follows on and relies on the business requirements (functional and non functional) and the platform architecture documents. 

It will also lean on associated project delivery documents such as;

- Naming Standards
- Versioning Standards 
- Logging Standards and Frameworks
- Error Handling Standards and Frameworks
- Notification Frameworks 
- API Design Standards and Frameworks
- Coding Standards
